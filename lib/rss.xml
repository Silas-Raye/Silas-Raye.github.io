I created The Observer for my first ever <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam" target="_blank">game jam</a>. The game jam was called <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://itch.io/jam/historically-accurate-game-jam-8" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://itch.io/jam/historically-accurate-game-jam-8" target="_blank">Historically Accurate Game Jam 8</a> or HAGJ8 for short, and the topic was famous assassinations. I chose to make a game about the abolitionist Elijah Parrish Lovejoy. A man who had his printing press destroyed four times! The structure of the game is based on actual historical events. You can read about them by clicking "History" on the game's homepage. Each level you must save enough money to buy a new printing press before before a mob ransacks your shop. Like Lovejoy you are encouraged to stop printing as continuing to play means risking your life and your livelihood for the sake of what you believe in.<br>Screenshots<br>

The backgrounds where made by and AI (Midjourney) and then touched up and stitched together by me. I would have preferred to use all human made art for the game, but this was impossible considering the small team and time constraint. The three character sprites where made by Momonga, the sound was made by Kaavee, the idea for the game was mine, and Maddhaus helped with play testing and development.<br><br><br>Coding, Creation of Background Art Using AI, Game Concept, and Graphics<br><br>Ideation, Play Testing, and Design Consulting<br><br>Sound Design and Music<br><br>Pixel Art Character Sprites]]></description><link>readme.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">readme.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 22:21:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE1MzY4NTczLnBuZw==/original/P7uLtX.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE1MzY4NTczLnBuZw==/original/P7uLtX.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

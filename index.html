							<h1>Hi my name is Silas Raye,</h1>
							<p>I graduated from the University of Florida in December of 2023. I see myself as a strategic thinker, and someone who values the importance of data to extract insights and inform better decision making.</p>
							<p>From childhood, I've had a fascination with numbers, stemming from my dyslexia which made them a more welcoming alternative to English. Embracing this affinity, I delved into the world of technology early on. My dyslexia led me to adopt emerging tools like voice-to-text and text-to-speech when they were still in their infancy. Because of this, I got to witnessing firsthand what AI could do, and I've been fascinated with it ever sense.</p>

									<h2>Predicting Pizza Wait Times</h2>
									<p>I created a linear model capable of forecasting wait times with a high degree of accuracy. I extracted 20 years of order data from an SQL database, cleaned the data in python and analyzed it R, and created visualizations and built reports to help communicate my findings. The project was a huge success and was implemented into the Point of Sale (or POS) system. The tool increased efficiency by helping wait staff to predict wait times on takeout order.</p>

									<h2>Stock Market Forecasting</h2>
									<p>I achieved a return on investment of 20% over 5 years by buying the same stocks as top wall street CEOs. I used a web scraper to collect data from the security and exchange commission's website (sec.gov). Next I used R to analyze and visualize the data. I discovered that insiders like CEOs and CFOs tend to beat the markets, sometimes by a lot, when they trade in company stock.</p>

									<h2>Magic: The Gathering Sentiment Analysis</h2>
									<p>This was a class project in which I attempted to forecast the prices of trading cards based on their in game abilities. I utilized various forms of natural language processing including bag of words, term frequency inverse document frequency, and large language models. I also made use of high dimensional linear approaches like lasso and ridge regression. The program was able to predict the price of cards with some accuracy, but more work is needed. However, this was one of my first serious data science projects and it taught me a lot.</p>

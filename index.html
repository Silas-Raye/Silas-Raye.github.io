							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I discovered I was dyslexic at age 8. My spelling and handwriting were so poor that I was placed in a school specializing in technology at age 11. By the age of 13, I was certified in the entire Microsoft Office Suite. By 15, I had earned certifications in all the Adobe programs and started learning to code. This early exposure helped me learn to face my challenges head-on, adapt, and develop a strong love for technology.</p>
						
						<div id="more-content" style="display: none;">
						  <p>My passion for computers began in elementary school due to my abysmal handwriting and spelling, which led me to use text-to-speech software. Back in 2010, the software barely worked, but I watched the technology evolve throughout my school career. Witnessing the computer turn my voice into words on a page felt like magic, and from that moment on, I was hooked on artificial intelligence.</p>
						  <p>My passion for graphic design started in middle school when I got certified in Photoshop and Illustrator. In high school, I took every tech elective available, diving into web design and video editing. I honed my skills by doing freelance design work for a local pizza joint. During the summers, I attended coding camps and took online classes, teaching myself C++ and Python, further fueling my interest in tech.</p>
						  <p>I studied data science at the University of Florida, graduating with honors a full year early. During my time at UF, I became even more enthralled with the advancements in machine learning and have strived to stay at the forefront of artificial intelligence. As a beta tester for OpenAI before they launched ChatGPT, I gained valuable insights into the field and have been passionately studying data science ever since.</p>

							<h1>Hi my name is Silas Raye,</h1>
							<p>I graduated from the University of Florida in December of 2023. I see myself as a strategic thinker, and someone who values the importance of data to extract insights and inform better decision making.</p>
							<p>I've always had a fascination with numbers due to my dyslexia, which made Math a more welcoming subject than English. Embracing this affinity, I delved into the world of technology early on. My dyslexia led me to adopt emerging tools like voice-to-text and text-to-speech when they were still in their infancy. Because of this, I became enthralled with the progress in machine learning and have made an effort to stay on the forefront of artificial intelligence. I was a beta tester for OpenAI before they launched ChatGPT and have been studying data science ever since.</p>

									<h2>Predicting Pizza Wait Times</h2>
									<p>I created a linear model capable of forecasting customer wait times for a small pizza business with a high degree of accuracy. I extracted twenty years of order data from a SQL database, cleaned the data in python and analyzed it R, and created visualizations, and built reports to help communicate my findings. The project was then implemented into the point of sale system and will increase efficiency by helping staff to predict wait times on takeout orders without disturbing the kitchen.</p>

									<h2>Stock Market Forecasting</h2>
									<p>I achieved a return on investment of 20% over five years by buying the same stocks as wall street CEOs. I used a web scraper to collect data from the security and exchange commission's website (<a href="https://www.sec.gov" target="_blank">sec.gov</a>). Next I used R to analyze and visualize the data. I discovered that insiders like CEOs and CFOs tend to beat the markets, sometimes by a lot, when they trade in company stock.</p>

									<h2>Magic: The Gathering Sentiment Analysis</h2>
									<p>This was a project for my Statistical Learning class in which I attempted to forecast the prices of trading cards based on their in-game abilities. I utilized various forms of natural language processing, including bag of words, term frequency inverse document frequency, and large language models, as well as high-dimensional linear approaches like lasso and ridge regression. The program was able to predict the price of cards with some accuracy, but I am currently readjusting this project to improve and refine it, as it was one of my first serious data science projects.</p>

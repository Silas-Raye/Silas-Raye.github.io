							<h2>Who I am</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My passion for computers began in elementary school due to my abysmal handwriting and spelling, which led me to use text-to-speech software. Back in 2010, the software barely worked, but I watched the technology evolve throughout my school career. Witnessing the computer turn my voice into words on a page felt like magic, and from that moment on, I was hooked on artificial intelligence.</p>
						<p>My passion for graphic design started in middle school when I got certified in Photoshop and Illustrator. In high school, I took every tech elective available, diving into web design and video editing. I honed my skills by doing freelance design work for a local pizza joint. During the summers, I attended coding camps and took online classes, teaching myself C++ and Python, further fueling my interest in tech.</p>
						<p>I studied data science at the University of Florida, graduating with honors a full year early. During my time at UF, I became even more enthralled with the advancements in machine learning and have strived to stay at the forefront of artificial intelligence. As a beta tester for OpenAI before they launched ChatGPT, I gained valuable insights into the field and have been passionately studying data science ever since.</p>

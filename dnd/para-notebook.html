Session 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bringing in the PC - Lily   </li>
<li>Lilly wakes from a dream, terrified. The last thing she remembers is training under the Madam at the Hill House, but the memory is blurry. As the memories fade like a dream upon waking the sense of fear remains. Sitting across from you is a figure clad in dark armor the joints held together with glowing golden Thread. A typical observer might take her to be a person, but you sense that she’s a fear spirit. One whose aura is almost nauseatingly strong; stronger even than Freddie’s. However the eect seems to be dampened considerably by the Thread and the armor working together somehow to contain the spirit. You would have noticed earlier if you weren’t so caught up, but the figure doesn’t seem to have a familiar. In her hand she clutches a piece of paper. As soon as you see it you remember a similar piece of paper folded and tucked into your overalls   </li>
<li>Bringing in the PC - Zulie   </li>
<li>Zulie doesn’t remember much. A flash of light. A dark alley, all who saw you running away in terror. Finding a battered set of black plate armor and putting it on. A garden city filled with as many plants as people. And a poster “HELP WANTED” printed in large red letters on the front. The same poster you are now holding in your hand   </li>
<li>Bringing in the PC - Daryun   </li>
<li>Go onto the porch and relate this before bringing him in…   </li>
<li>You were relaxing in a tavern in the garden city of Twe: stronghold of the Asamoah, the house responsible for growing food. You had just finished a rather easy and not too well paying mercenary job when the giant red letters of a help wanted poster caught your eye from across the room   </li>
<li>Sankt Peter is the stronghold of House Vorontsov, the house of transport   </li>
<li>You travel to the docks and board the VTO (Vorontsov Transport Organization) Skyship Fidelity over the course of the next hour two more passengers board and the ship takes o   </li>
<li>Meet the Vorontsovs   </li>
<li>The party takes the Fidelity to Sankt Peter, the city in the sky   </li>
<li>There they meet Valery Vorontsov (atrophied legs, Thread wings)   </li>
<li>After a monologue about his dream and asking each of them their dreams, Valery tells them that their hired   </li>
<li>He needs them to track down missing sky-ships making up almost half of the VTO fleet, thus the need for discretion and urgency. He can’t have the other housing knowing half his fleet vanished overnight   </li>
<li>He hands each of them a card granting them free transport on any VTO ship for the duration of the investigation. If they find the missing ships they will get to keep the cards and will be granted 1,500 gp each   </li>
<li>Meet the Cortas   </li>
<li>Their employer provides them with a scrap of torn cloth found at the docks that the ships sailed o from   </li>
<li>The cloth is emblazoned with the insignia of House Corta   </li>
<li>If the party visits Boa Vista they hear rumors that the heir to the house was assassinated by a Mackenzie blade   </li>
<li>The Mackenzies have resented the Cortas since they broke o and started their own House   </li>
<li>Adriana claims that the Cortas have nothing to hide   </li>
<li>She points out that the Thread sails are the truly valuable part of the ships, and the Cortas have Thread in abundance   </li>
<li>Tracking the Ships From Sankt Peter   </li>
<li>The party returns to Sankt Peter and tracks the ships from the docks using their departure vector   </li>
<li>After traveling for several hours the party finds a few pieces of debris from the ships, but not nearly enough to account for the number of ships that went missing   </li>
<li>They also find a few survivors from the ships who tell them that the ships were attacked by war-forged and Automatons   </li>
<li>With a history check the party members can identify the automatons as belonging to House Mackenzie   </li>
<li>They find no other definitive clues as to where the ships might be   </li>
<li>Session 1 Notes   </li>
<li>Same time next week - Yes   </li>
<li>Start the next session with a recap   </li>
<li>With a history check the party members can identify the automatons as belonging to House Mackenzie   </li>
<li>Give Daryun a sword in the stone type moment where he can’t get it one session and then a bunch of sessions down the road he can   </li>

<li>Takver can explain the teachings of Odo and the government of Twe if asked   </li>
<li>Takver wants the party to clear out a bunch of small not yet sentient automatons living in the caves by her village   </li>
<li>Make this an super easy encounter   </li>
<li>If asked, Moscap will liken it to an abortion. They feel no remorse towards robots that haven’t yet woken up   </li>
<li>Even still they party can attempt to care for the swarm of small automatons and help them to wake up. This will be hard but not impossible   </li>
<li>Travel into the Mountains   </li>

Session 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Leaving Anarres   </li>
<li>The party wakes up to the sun slanting in through the windows of the boarding house at the center of the town.   </li>
<li>Takver, Shevek, Frank, and Mosscap meet them at the platform.   </li>
<li>Takver bids them farewell and thanks them for clearing out the bats in the cave.   </li>
<li>Shevek tells Lily that he has fixed Frank, and he will now only respond to her commands unless she tells him to respond to other masters.   </li>
<li>Frank has a brand new set of legs. His chest plate has been polished and a small window shows a slowly unraveling ball of Thread feeding into some sort of power core. Next to the power core is a glass orb not unlike the one containing the locate object spell, but where that orb swirls with purple light, this orb is empty.   </li>
<li>Mosscap brought each of the players a bag of dried mushrooms as snacks for the trip.   </li>
<li>The two captains Jof (the one who’s ship crashed) and Garet have also come to see the party o. They will be staying in Anarres where they will be starting a life together.   </li>

<li>The first player to cry out Aye starts   </li>
<li>They bid a face value, and the number of die they think have that value (1s are wild)   </li>
<li>The next player has to raise either the face value or the number of dice. Or they can challenge   </li>

<li>2-4 players are equipped with smashers. You use your smashers to gather thimbles. You gather a thimble by hitting a stone through the opponent’s smashing window. You close a smashing window by hitting two thimbles through the window thus gathering two stones. Stones may be gathered by other means as well, two points for square throw and three for a if you’re playing Golbarthian rules, but nobody plays by Golbarthian rules. For every square, a thimble   </li>

<li>Freddie finds a letter in Ace’s oce   </li>
<li>Jade is worried Ace is onto her   </li>

<li>Dear Mother,   </li>
<li>Ace knows I had Rafa killed, and he suspects my involvement in other matters. I fear for my safety here.   </li>
<li>Robert’s Investigation   </li>
<li>He tells the party that Jade Sun disappeared from her room the night before last   </li>
<li>There was no sign of struggle, and no clues, but he suspects Corta blades kidnap her in retribution for Rafa’s death   </li>
<li>He swears he didn’t kill Rafa, and says it’s typical of the Cortas to blame the Mackenzies   </li>
<li>If the party is able to sweet talk him, he’ll show them her rooms   </li>
<li>They find a single book in her desk   </li>
<li>What Ace Knows   </li>
<li>Ace took over for the dock master on the night when the ships landed and where stashed away   </li>
<li>That’s why the dock master looked shifty   </li>
<li>That also means Ace knows where the ships are   </li>
<li>Robert is too arrogant to mistrust Jade, but Ace has been intercepting her letters on outbound mail ships, and suspects her of spying   </li>
<li>A few weeks ago he overheard her telling a Sun ambassador (trained as an assassin) to kill Rafa   </li>
<li>Tracking Jade   </li>
<li>Jade went to Fuxi with a shipment of steel   </li>
<li>She paid the pilot handsomely to keep her presence on the ship quiet   </li>
<li>And she disguised herself as an extra precaution   </li>
<li>Return to Sankt Peter   </li>
<li>Rest up   </li>
<li>Get paid (1,500 gp each) if they found the ships   </li>
<li>Lucas has sent them a letter saying his investigation yielded nothing, and he wants to hire them to investigate the murder of his brother   </li>
<li>Give the party another lead to start tracking down Jade Sun-Mackenzie and finding out the truth of the Sun’s involvement (if they need it)   </li>
<li>Session 4 Notes   </li>
<li>Lilly is now Echo   </li>
<li>It came on when she put on the headband of intelligence and she regained all her memories   </li>
<li>Lucas Corta is meeting them at noon tomorrow and will pay them 500 gold each to find out who killed Rafa   </li>
<li>They go to Fuxi to find Jade   </li>
<li>And also to do Echo’s back story   </li>
<li>The party is now named the flower family   </li>
<li>The party hears about Valery recovering his ships   </li>
<li>Drop a major plot hook for the nature of magic side story   </li>
<li>Do some combat   </li>
<li>Begin Arc 2!!   </li>

<strong>New Plan:</strong>   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cadence is Missing   </p>
</li>
<li>“Alice is Missing” is a narrative-driven role-playing game that takes place entirely through a messaging app interface on a player’s phone. The game is played in real-time and lasts approximately 90 minutes.   </li>
<li>The premise of the game is that the player is a friend of a missing girl named Alice, and they must work together with other players to uncover the mystery of her disappearance. The game is divided into several phases, each with its own set of tasks and objectives.   </li>
<li>Phase 1: Discovery (0-15 minutes) The game begins with the discovery that Alice is missing. Players are tasked with introducing themselves to each other, exchanging information and discussing what they know about Alice and her disappearance. They must also gather clues by exploring Alice’s phone and social media accounts.   </li>
<li>Phase 2: Investigation (15-45 minutes) In this phase, players must use the clues they have collected to investigate Alice’s disappearance. They must interview suspects, gather evidence, and use their deduction skills to piece together what happened to Alice.   </li>
<li>Phase 3: Confrontation (45-75 minutes) As players gather more evidence, they begin to uncover the truth behind Alice’s disappearance. They must confront the suspects and try to get them to confess. The players must work together to make sure they have enough evidence to solve the case.   </li>
<li>Phase 4: Resolution (75-90 minutes) In the final phase, the players must decide what to do with the information they have gathered. They must choose how to bring the case to a close and determine what happens to Alice and the suspects.   </li>
<li>Overall, “Alice is Missing” is a unique and immersive game that provides a fascinating experience for players who enjoy mystery and investigation games.   </li>

Interlude 2 - Zulie and Lilly Look for Cadence</h3>
<ul>
<li>cadence is lost the night of the honeymoon   </li>
<li>the 0th thread with the power to span the spaces between worlds is lost with her   </li>
<li>7 years pass   </li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8888/Braided/People/Silas/Cadence.html">Cadence</a> finds herself on Asteria. Click the link for more about how she spends her time.   </li>
<li>Magic items to keep an eye on   <ul>
<li>The 0th thread currently residing at the school at Asteria   <ul>
<li>Zulie's first thread created during the events of the the thread bear campaign   </li>
<li>this magic item is more powerful than any other threads she creates afterwards   </li>
<li>It doesn't dissolve after use. But only diminishes in length. And as long as it is attuned it regrows.   </li>
<li>cadence takes the 0th thread (owned by nobody) and accidentally travels to Asteria where she uses it to found the school. Wiring Asterian ships with it   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The 1st thread. Currently making up zuli's familiar. Oh yeah, Zulie figured out how to make up familiar out of her thread during the 7 years.   <ul>
<li>Zulie has her own copy. The first thread. And she uses it to take herself and Lily to Asteria   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second thread   <ul>
<li>Phoenix's cat (rename inferno to ember? Stick with the name spark?)   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the headband of 19 int   <ul>
<li>how did the headband get it's 19 int. it took all the memmories from it's users and only gave them back when it saw fit.   </li>
<li>has Cadence and Lilly's Memmories in it   </li>
<li>Lily's memories can be bestowed upon Nix forcing a change using the headband of 19 intelligence. This will cause the erasure of some of the madam's most painful memories as gray will be replaced with Nyx's personality. Additionally when Lily tries to become gray she will instead become nicks with a grayish hue. An astral elf with stars speckling her skin.   </li>
<li>Cadence is dead, but her memories from the headband can force a change on Phoenix who will gain her likeness as a second personality. Though she too will be a gray astral elf.   </li>
<li>has a memmory of old combat's that it took from the party   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cadence ends up on Asteria   </li>
<li>Lily and Zulie are stuck on Para for 7 years   <ul>
<li>time skip. what would they like to spend the year doing?   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eventually St Zulie of the threads pray's hard enough to get The Saint of Justice (see name in para notes). She shows them how the bridge can be used bent to travel to other worlds. But at a terrible price. That is why it's looped back on itself. Long ago the gods found no other true arrangement.   </li>
<li>They use a single strand of thread each. Taken from Zulie who has gained the power to manufacture thread with her own body. This process takes time but after 7 years there is enough for both of them to make the trip.   </li>
<li>They are warned again and again of the dangers inherent with bridging worlds.   </li>
<li>They find themselves on another world. This one too has a bridge. It is festival night on MDO.   </li>
<li>Notes:   <ul>

The Nature of Magic</h2>
<ul>
<li>Everyone is born with a soul that manifests in the physical world as they’re familiar. All magic derives from these souls.   </li>
<li>Wizards perform arcane heart surgery breaking their souls and reconstructing them to become more powerful. Wizards familiars often appear like shattered glass.   </li>
<li>Arcane Trickster Rogues are like wizards through study they are able to somewhat open their souls and let magic pass through more easily, but unlike wizards they do not completely reshape their souls merely opening them up a little bit.   </li>
<li>Warlocks sell their souls and in return are loaned the magic of a being with a much greater more powerful soul than their own. Consequently warlocks go without familiars.   </li>
<li>Witches bond closely with their souls and pull them further into the material plane drawing on their souls’ magic and the magic of other untethered souls to fuel their spells.   </li>
<li>Paladins and Clerics give their families up to a higher power, and become part of that power in return. They still have their familiars, but they are now an extension of a greater being’s soul. On loan to their original owner until their death. Each person who worships a saint bolsters that saint’s power by amassing the number of souls it has control over. Oathbreakers who leave the church they have sworn themselves to irrevocably corrupt their familiar.   </li>
<li>Druids and Rangers draw gently on the souls of all living things around them. However, druids are careful never to take more than they need, and never to take so much that they cause harm. Hypothetically a druid of evil intentions could make all the land wither around them as they sucked the magic out of it, but in practice anybody who would do that would never be instructed in the circles of druidry.   </li>
<li>Sorcerers’ souls are naturally more powerful than other humans. Whether because of a magical ancestor or because of pure luck sorcerers familiars are usually larger than typical familiars.   </li>
<li>Bards are a combination of arcane tricksters and sorcerers. Like arcane tricksters they may have somewhat opened their soul through study, and like sorcerers they can have some innate power though perhaps their bloodline connection is more distant.   </li>

The Coven of Strings</h2>
<p>The Coven of Strings subscribes to a philosophy that all spiritual entities are <br>
interconnected by the threads of fate and the woven bonds they made while <br>
alive. They use this knowledge to barter with the spirits and delve deeper into <br>
the spiritual realm that binds them, harnessing the secrets that govern the very <br>
basis of spiritual existence and finding the connections between the physical <br>
and spiritual world. <br>
The Covenant of Strings, as a result of their bartering nature, is more <br>
sympathetic to the spirits these witches bind. Witches of this covenant tend to <br>
see spirits more as allies, collecting objects of importance from their spirits as a <br>
means of re-summoning the same ones. They trust the spirits they bind enough <br>
to allow their power to grow under their command with the purpose of sharing <br>
this power   </p>

Xolotl</h3>
<ul>
<li>only living god   </li>
<li>"the trickster"   </li>
<li>There was one god that did not bind himself to the forge at the end of the world. The trickster god Xolotl. On the first day, he shapeshifted into a serpent and slithered away, but he was soon caught. On the second day, he disguised himself as a coyote and this lasted longer, but ultimately he was still caught. On the third and final day when all the gods were to be bound to the forge, he shapeshifted into an axolotl and slipped away. Xolotl still roams Para to this day; although, no one knows it. He is the only unchained god.   </li>

The Bridge</h3>
<ul>
<li>“Something slithers past you in the dark. You feel all the nightmares that have come out when the sun goes down, since the cave times, when people huddled together in fear, for safety, and for warmth. All those nightmares are swirling around you and only the bridge is holding them at bay. Now is the time to be afraid of the dark. You are taken by the absolute certainty that something is about to creep over your face, but all you can do is close your eyes: it makes no dierence to what you see or feel. The darkness is complete. You begin to hallucinate. You are a small child, walking home from school, at night, down the one road with no streetlights. No matter how many times you do it, it never gets any easier, never gets any better. You are deep in the sewers, lost in a labyrinth, a beast is waiting for you in the sewers ahead. You know the beast is waiting. It charges at you, through the dark. You die, and you keep walking. Slowly, agonizingly slowly, it charges at you, over and over, through the dark, but all you can do is keep walking. There is a flare so bright it hurts. It appears you have crossed the bridge successfully.”</li>

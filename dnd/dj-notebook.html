<h2>Finished Sessions</h2>
<h3>Braided Session 0 - Cornell</h3>
<p>Silas: The barter Man. (Art: A powerful demon from a roaring '20s mobster era City. Fantasy art style. -Midjourny) appears before you and offers you a deal. One time offer kid. Their soul for yours. You can get yourself out of this universe, but you'll take at least one person with you.   </p>
<p>Luke: Wat   </p>
<p>Silas: If you accept the deal, (you can even pick your favorite barter man or reprompt the art AI if you don't like any of mine). The soul of Cornell Blackwater and Phoenix Vance will disappear from Lovato's forever. A great barred once said to be or not to be that is the question. You've both agreed. Now all you have to do is seal the deal. Phoenix turns to glance at you as the bartiman slides a contract across the table. To looming blank lines at the bottom of the page   </p>
<p>Luke: Cornell will sign   </p>
<p>Silas: I'm glad we agree that, happens to be my favorite one as well, Phoenix quips as the four shifting images resolve into one and Phoenix signs and dots their name on the paper boldly as Em or Bur never could before. You glance over, and meeting Phoenix's eyes, sign your name. The world around you turns to Ash and dust and then blows away. The only thing left in your vision is the lingering face of the barter man. He looks happy with the deal that he's gotten.   </p>
<p>Luke: We love Azacar   </p>
<p>Silas: As you wake on fusiongauge you remember his last words to you. "Only one soul can fit in the body. Twin soul miscreants like your friends Phoenix and Lilly are trouble enough. Two souls were lost today. For your soul I took the soul of Ember. Phoenix too paid their price.   </p>
<p>Luke: Oh yikes   </p>
<p>Silas: Phoenix wakes up next to you   </p>
<p>Luke: "You alright, love?"   </p>
<p>Silas: <em>violent coughing</em> Sputters... Where the hell are we Cornell? You're not captain anymore without your ship. Phoenix says as they stand and brush themselves off   </p>
<p>Luke: Can I look arundo?   </p>
<p>Silas: At a first glance you wonder if you hit your head the mountains around you seem to be somehow into places at once (like one of Ant's 3D movies viewed without glasses)   </p>
<p>Silas: You can roll perception if you like   </p>
<p>Luke: 12   </p>
<p>Silas: You don't feel any pain in your head or anywhere else in your body other than a residual soreness in the lungs. The mountains genuinely seem to be in two places at once blurring where they overlap   </p>
<p>Luke: "I'm not sure, Phoenix. Whatever we signed ourselves up for with Azacar must've shot us here   </p>
<p>Silas: An event that will come to be known simply as 'The Crash' has just taken place.   </p>
<p>Luke: Oh penis and balls. Ur doing that story, sick   </p>
<p>Silas: (No, that's your story. And you're more than welcome to run sessions set in that 7 years span) You spend the next 7 years with Phoenix. Wars break out as Dríains' attack fusiongauge attempting to take its fusion technology. Wars continue as Gadure's attack Mag Draíocht attempting to steal its runic magic. Powers rise and fall. Yet much stays the same as no magic seems to work on FG, and no fusion seems to work on MDO (That is official DM shorthand. Spelling it is hard lol). Though around the world a new class of magician begins to pop up. Dimension jumpers they are called. And they allow people to travel between the worlds at places other than the doubled peaks, and on events other than the festival of Samhain. Each year on the anniversary of the crash the festival takes place. But that's a story for another time   </p>
<p>7 years from today you in Phoenix find yourself in the double peaks on festival night. See you on Halloween   </p>
<p>Afterward ~ Two Worlds, One Song: After the crash, there was a year of exploration during which powers from both worlds sent exploratory parties to the new mountains. The following year was mostly ravaged by war, which reached its peak on the two-year anniversary of the crash. All was quiet on both planar fronts as people didn't know if something new or unexpected would happen; after all, two worlds had collided. Troops were arrayed along all four sides of the double peaks. Some scouts emerged from each side, mostly young children aged 15 to 17, soldiers drafted before their time. Phoenix and Cornell, too, strolled out, having found themselves on opposite sides of the war, with Phoenix on MDO and Cornell on FG. However, instead of fighting, Phoenix and Cornell both broke out into song. It was an old sea shanty they both knew from Cornell's time as a ship captain. It promised new sails and open seas. Phoenix sang it in Gadure, and Cornell in Dríain. Miraculously, their fellow soldiers joined in the song. Somehow, they knew it too. A night of merriment commenced, and in the morning, both FG and MDO laid down their arms and agreed that one world was enough for them. They considered themselves lucky to have been blessed with two. This marked the second annual festival of Samhain. Five years later: Samhain Session on Tuesday night. Come dressed as your character, even if that's just a t-shirt and jeans.   </p>

<strong>Premise</strong></h2>
<p>The Dimension Jumper campaign is unique in that it doesn't take place in just one world, but rather in two. Long ago, in a world-changing event called the Crash, the planes of Fusiongauge and Mag Draíocht collided. The campaign is set about 500 years after the Crash. Nowadays, skilled mages known as dimension jumpers facilitate travel between the planes. But there's a catch, the universal constants — while similar — aren't exactly the same across the two worlds. A quirk in the makeup of Fusiongauge makes nuclear fusion incredibly easy to achieve there. However, the same quirk makes magic impossible. Mag Draíocht has the opposite problem. Magic may be possible, but fusion isn't.   </p>

Dimension Jumper Class</h2>
<p>Dimension jumpers are a support class able to open portals between the worlds at will. They can also imbue items and people with physics from either plane. Portals between worlds are somewhat common, but the ability to summon them at will is still coveted. It’s also not uncommon for large wealthy cities to employ dimension jumpers to keep their city running in both worlds.   </p>

Technicalities</h3>
<ul>
<li>When jumping you can’t appear in a wall. You’ll just be placed either to the left or the right of it.   </li>
<li>If you run into a portal you can run out the other side, but there is no infinite momentum like in the video game Portal.   </li>
<li>Bullets and arrows can pass through portals, but a fireball will fizzle out.   </li>

<p>Mechanical titans once walked  Fusiongauge they're based off the titans  from Nausicaa. Now dead, the skeletons of  the titans litter the landscape. Cities like <a href="http://localhost:8888/Braided/Settings/Dimension%20Jumper/Dimension%20Jumper%20Notebook.html#places" class="anchor-link">Places</a> are often built in the skeletons of  titans as they offer moderate protection  from the elements.

Prehistory</h3>
<p>Long ago, Danu, the mother goddess, gave birth to ten children who would later become the Tuatha dé Danann (or the children of Danu). Some years later, the Tuatha dé Danann fled to the four outer cities to escape a great war. They learned the secrets of science, art, agriculture, craftsmanship, architecture, and — most importantly — magic and druidry. When they returned to Mag Draíocht, they brought a dark mist that eclipsed the sky for three days and three nights. They also brought with them four magic artifacts, one from each city.   </p>
<p>Upon their return, the Tuatha dé Danann found the war still raging. The endless war had changed the people into a warlike race known as the firbolg. The Tuatha dé Danann offered the firbolg two choices: either 1) continue their never-ending war in the north and cede the south to the Tuatha dé Danann, and the remaining people not yet corrupted, or 2) face war with the Tuatha dé Danann. The firbolg, unsurprisingly, chose war. The battle raged for three days and three nights. The Tuatha dé Danann won, banishing the firbolg to a small northern province, but their victory came at a price. Nuada, King of the Tuatha dé Danann, lost his right arm in the battle. No longer fit to be king, Nuada stepped down, and Bress took his place.   </p>
<p>Bress, however, was half Fomorian, and he made the people of Mag Draíocht into slaves. Nuada went into hiding, emerging after seven years with a new arm wrought of silver, crafted by Creidhne in secret. This earned him the epithet Nuada, of the Silver Arm. He re-took his place as the rightful king of the Tuatha dé Danann and banished Bress, who was never heard from again. Nuada then made a truce with the firbolg, who had become less warlike and taken up a pastoral life during their time in exile.   </p>

<strong>Automatons</strong></h3>
<p>There was once an ambitious master engineer. Inspired by the titans, he sought to create life. The engineer gave their all to birth such a creation, until finally, using clockwork prosthetics, the scientist created fully sentient automatons. At first they were mindless machines, blindly following orders, but eventually the engineer discovered how to upload other creatures' consciousness to them. Once uploaded they'd ask questions and wonder if they too were living beings. No such answer was found, and the scientist disappeared in the wake of their creations. Most automatons nowadays remain mindless servants. However, some possess the minds of once living creatures.   </p>

Fae</h3>
<p><strong>Noun:</strong> Fae <br>

<p>Fae are like elves from the Forgotten Realms. They're based off fairies or fair folk from celtic mythology. The fae are said to be the direct descendants of the Tuatha dé Danann. Unlike the dwarfs who are skilled in the creation of magical items, the fae some innate magical abilities and they can cast spells. However, they are less magically talented than the dwarfs.   </p>

Firbolg</h3>
<p>Firbolg were the dominant race before the  return of the Tuatha dé Danann. After  countless years at war among themselves,  they lost to the Tuatha dé Danann and were  relegated to a small northern province where  they became less warlike and took up a  pastoral life. Even after their treaty with the  Tuatha dé Danann, the Firbolg were still  discriminated against. Though  discrimination diminished in the years  following the Crash, many Draíans still  distrust the Firbolg.    </p>

Hybrids</h3>
<p>Hybrids are a race of magically and genetically modified humans and fae. To clarify, hybrids are not half-elves or half-fae. Their in-game stats are based loosely off Simic hybrids although, unlike Simic hybrids, they don’t have animal parts. Currently the only known source of hybrids are the Domhan labs on Coriolis.   </p>

Runes</h2>
<p>All magic comes from somewhere. Warlocks channel magic from their patron, paladins channel magic from their god, sorcerers channel magic through their blood, and wizards take the innate magic of the world and focus it with their mind and an arcane focus.   </p>
<p>Similarly runes must draw their power from somewhere. Runes are just like magical instructions executing a spell, but without power they can't cast anything. Most ancient runes were tied to strong sources of natural power: like a god or an extremely ancient oak tree. More modern runes draw their power from the innate magic of the world; this allows them to work anywhere on mdo, but it can limit their output. More powerful spells require hundreds of tiny power aggregation runes painstakingly inscribed across an object. Your tattoo seems to draw power from the world (this is odd because runes that draw power from the world is a recent discovery, but your runes look ancient), but no way would that be enough power for what you claim they can do. There must be something else at work there   </p>

The Fomori</h2>
<p><em>/foam-or-ee/</em>   </p>
<p><strong>Singular:</strong> Fomorian    </p>
<p><strong>Plural:</strong> Fomori   </p>
<p><strong>Etymology:</strong> "fo" means under and "mór" means great or big. So "Fomorian" roughly translates to "the great underworld ones" or "the underworld giants"   </p>
<p>The Fomori represent the harmful or destructive powers of nature. They are personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight, and drought. They exist in opposition to the Tuatha dé Danann who represent growth and civilization. The Fomori and the Tuatha dé Danann are descended from the sister goddesses Domnu and Danu respectively.   </p>
<p>Domnu is the mother of the ancient race of the Fomori, older sister of Danu, who we meet at the Winter Solstice. Their story symbolises the struggle between light and shadow. Not much is known about either goddesses both in the campaign and in real life.   </p>

<ul>
<li>The origin of the Gnolls traces back to the great famine (pre-crash). Whether Yeenoghu caused the famine or was drawn to it remains unknown to this day. Conservitive estimates put the death toll at a little over half of the population of Mag Draíocht.  Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in Yeenoghu wake, scavenging the Fomori lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first Gnolls. The Gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of the great famine.   </li>

The Veil</h2>
<p>The Veil is the space between the worlds. It’s less of a place and more of a space between places. If Fusiongauge and Mag Draíocht were adjacent rooms the Veil would be the doorway connecting them.   </p>

Jump Alloy</h2>
<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> Veilenium <em>/veil-en-e-um/</em>   </p>
<p><strong>Etymology:</strong> "Vale" from the Veil and "enium" is a suffix that simply means metal   </p>
<p>"Two metals form an alloy, coming together to create a stronger whole. If you can make an alloy as strong as steel from something as simple as iron and carbon, imagine the properties of an alloy made from the collision of two planes!?"   </p>
<p>Veilenium is more well known as Jump Alloy or just Alloy for short. Alloy is slightly softer than iron and has an iridescent look, not unlike real-world bismuth. Alloy is a critical component for dimension jumpers. Additionally, Fusion reactors made of Alloy and Spellweaver runes inscribed in Alloy work on both planes. Because of this and because it can only be found in the Doubled Peaks alloy is expensive and rare.   </p>

Coriolis</h3>
<p>Coriolis is one of the largest cities on either world. The city is kept "online" by dimension jumpers working around the clock. The Fusiongauge side side of Coriolis is built in the skeleton of a titan.   </p>
<p>The city is is home to two large scale crime syndicates. The Deadbolts on Fusiongauge and    </p>
<p>The Domhan on Mag Draíocht. Street rats living in the city speak a language they call creole: a weird amalgamation of Gauger and Draian.   </p>

<strong>The Deadbolts</strong></h4>
<p><em>/dead-bolts/</em>   </p>
<p>The Deadbolts control the Fusiongauge side of Coriolis. The Deadbolts main base there is called the Keyp. The gang is led by an outwardly jovial, wide set human man named Henderson McKerras-Key <em>/mc-care-is/</em>   </p>

<strong>The Domhan</strong></h4>
<p><em>/doom-han/</em>   </p>
<p>The Domhan control the Mag Draíocht side of Coriolis. Domhan means underworld in Irish. The gang is lead by a white tabaxi woman named Pangur Ban. She has one green eye, one blue eye, and a steely demeanor. The gang is sometimes referred to as the Domhan Ban to show reverence to her.   </p>
<p>The Domhan also conduct experiments to create creatures called hybrids.   </p>
<p>Pangur Ban is like Astrid Dane: power hungry and willing to magically control people to getwhat she wants.   </p>

The Doubled Peaks</h3>
<p>Fusiongauge and Mag Draíocht intersect at a 22o angle. The Crash formed the Doubled Peaks are a prominent mountain range where the planes meet. The peaks exist in both worlds simultaneously; this, in conjunction with valuable deposits of Jump Alloy, makes the Doubled Peaks a vibrant cultural center. They get their name from the blurry mirror image of their counterpart mountain range visible through the Veil.   </p>
